# Green Stocks Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project is to make more efficient the original script so it can be used for scalability and analyze a broader set of stocks


## Results

Refactoring makes the analysis faster, almost by 1/4 of the time than the original script. This is a lot if we scale it, and since it is time, that means that it also brings economical impact on the resources used.

## Summary

  1) What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
  In general I can conclude that refactoring has advantages, in our analysis it is great for scalability since it reduces running time meaning that with less resources we can get the same result, if we use the refactored code we can analyze more stocks in less time.
  Another advantage is that it is easier to read for future reference.
  The only disadvantage that I fount is only a one-timer disadvantage and it it the time spent to refactore it; anyway if we pretend to use the code with a lot of frequency it is worth to rethink about it and save time for future analysis.
  
  2) How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
